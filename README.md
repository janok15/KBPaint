# KBPaint
This was my student project for DAT113 Software Development I.

One of the available tasks was to make a paint program in Java. I made a replica of the original MacPaint, with a few added extras.

If you want to experiment with it, an executable .jar file, compiled for Windows, can be found in the binary folder.
